The ISS may be larger than a football field, but it's got only so many ways to get inside, and with crewed spacecraft and uncrewed cargo ships regularly shuttling up and down, docking ports-or at least the right docking port-can be at a premium.</p>\n<p>In the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 28, space station astronaut Scott Kelly, along with cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka, will be required to do a bit of delicate flying to sort just that kind of problem out.</p>\n<p>The three crewmen arrived at the station on March 29, with Padalka slated to spend six months aloft, and Kelly and Kornienko scheduled for a marathon <a href=\"http://time.com/space-nasa-scott-kelly-mission/\">one year in space</a>. They docked their Soyuz spacecraft at the station's Poisk module-a 16-ft. (4.8 m) Russian node that was added to the ISS in 2009 as a science lab, observation point and egress compartment for astronauts embarking on spacewalks. It's remained there ever since, and that's a concern.</p>\n<p>The five-plus months the ship has been hanging off the station in the alternating searing heat and deep freeze of orbital space can take its toll on the hardware, and since the crews rely on the ships as their way back to Earth, NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, instituted a rule: 180 days is the maximum amount of time a Soyuz can remain aloft before detaching and returning to Earth. But Kelly and Kornienko are set to stay for 365 days-which complicates their ride home.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=\"http://time.com/space\">TIME is producing a series of documentary films about the record-breaking mission to space. Watch them here</a>.</p>\n<p>Their Soyuz is not the only one that's on hand. There's another one for the other three crewmembers who are currently aboard.

        description: "One of the trickiest questions for a Soyuz spacecraft approaching the International Space Station (ISS) is where to park.

The ISS may be larger than a football field, but it's got only so many ways to get inside, and with crewed spacecraft and uncrewed cargo ships regularly shuttling up and down, docking ports-or at least the right docking port-can be at a premium.</p><p>In the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 28, space station astronaut Scott Kelly, along with cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka, will be required to do a bit of delicate flying to sort just that kind of problem out.</p><p>The three crewmen arrived at the station on March 29, with Padalka slated to spend six months aloft, and Kelly and Kornienko scheduled for a marathon one year in space. They docked their Soyuz spacecraft at the station's Poisk module-a 16-ft. (4.8 m) Russian node that was added to the ISS in 2009 as a science lab, observation point and egress compartment for astronauts embarking on spacewalks. It's remained there ever since, and that's a concern.</p><p>The five-plus months the ship has been hanging off the station in the alternating searing heat and deep freeze of orbital space can take its toll on the hardware, and since the crews rely on the ships as their way back to Earth, NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, instituted a rule: 180 days is the maximum amount of time a Soyuz can remain aloft before detaching and returning to Earth. But Kelly and Kornienko are set to stay for 365 days-which complicates their ride home.</p><p>MORE: TIME is producing a series of documentary films about the record-breaking mission to space. Watch them here.</p><p>Their Soyuz is not the only one that's on hand. There's another one for the other three crewmembers who are currently aboard. (Another NASA-Roscosmos rule: there must always be enough seats for everyone to be able to bail out immediately in the event of an emergency.) And on September 2, a third ship, carrying three more crew members, is set to arrive for a changeover of personnel.

      content: "The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, and the ISS is now the largest artificial body in orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets as well as American Space Shuttles.\n\nThe ISS serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and other fields. The station is suited for the testing of spacecraft systems and equipment required for missions to the Moon and Mars. The ISS maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435 km (205 and 270 mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the Zvezda module or visiting spacecraft. It completes 15.54 orbits per day.\n\nISS is the ninth space station to be inhabited by crews, following the Soviet and later Russian Salyut, Almaz, and Mir stations as well as Skylab from the US. The station has been continuously occupied for 14 years and 319 days since the arrival of Expedition 1 on 2 November 2000. This is the longest continuous human presence in space, having surpassed the previous record of 9 years and 357 days held by Mir. The station is serviced by a variety of visiting spacecraft: Soyuz, Progress, the Automated Transfer Vehicle, the H-II Transfer Vehicle, Dragon, and Cygnus. It has been visited by astronauts, cosmonauts and space tourists from 15 different nations.\n\nAfter the US Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, Soyuz rockets became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the International Space Station, and Dragon became the only provider of bulk cargo-return-to-Earth services (downmass capability of Soyuz capsules is very limited).\n\nThe ISS programme is a joint project among five participating space agencies: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA. The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The station is divided into two sections, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the United States Orbital Segment (USOS), which is shared by many nations. As of January 2014, the American portion of ISS was funded until 2024. Roscosmos has endorsed the continued operation of ISS through 2024, but have proposed using elements of the Russian Orbital Segment to construct a new Russian space station called OPSEK.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station",

Sharks pose a serious threat to humans.</em> <p>Shark attacks often mean a media feeding frenzy: Coverage includes shots of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsoSVPgPRU\">bloody victims</a>, pictures of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/11581447/Cape-Town-man-survived-great-white-shark-attack-by-poking-it-in-the-eye.html\">great whites with gaping jaws</a> and illogical descriptions such as \" <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/23/reunion-island-shark-problem_n_7104934.html\">shark-infested waters</a>.\" (Sharks live in the oceans. They are not an infestation.) After an attack in North Carolina this summer, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjUfPwLzjoU\">audio of a 911 call</a> from a distressed bystander saying, \"It looks like her entire hand is gone\" was all over the Internet. </p> \n<p>With such treatment, no wonder sharks are <a href=\"http://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the-animals-you-are-the-most-scared-of\">one of the most feared</a> animals in the world. But shark attacks are actually quite rare. There are almost 400 shark species, and only <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0613_050613_sharkfacts.html\">about a dozen</a> have ever committed documented attacks on humans. According to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History, only 70 attacks occurred on average each year in the past decade, with a handful per year <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/statsw.htm\">proving fatal</a>. Recorded attacks have risen significantly since the 1960s - by 200 percent - though that's mostly <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/isaf/2014summary.html\"> attributable</a> to an increase in people swimming in the sea for leisure and to better gathering of data. </p>\n<p>The risk of a shark attack while you're in the water is infinitesimally small: about 11.5 million to 1. Humans are <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/11644785/Which-animal-kills-the-most-humans.html\">more likely to have deadly encounters</a> with lions (which kill about 100 of us yearly), crocodiles (around 1,000) or snakes (close to 50,000). You're <a href=\"http://www.sharkattacknews.org/2014/10/human-bites-occur-ten-times-more-often.html\">10 times more likely to be bitten by another human</a> in New York City than you are by a shark anywhere on the planet.</p> \n<p>The threat, in fact, is the other way around: The World Wildlife Fund estimates that people slaughter <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/shark\">about 100 million</a> sharks per year. They're caught commercially for their liver oil, meat and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/shark-fin-soup-contains-endangered-species-new-analysis-shows/2012/08/09/a263d096-e25e-11e1-ae7f-d2a13e249eb2_story.html\">fins</a>, or they die because of sport fishing, drum lines (aquatic traps from which sharks usually don't emerge alive) and beach protection netting. These animals take several years to mature and often produce few young; many species face extinction. </p> \n<em>2. Sharks have to keep swimming.</em> <p>It's been <a href=\"http://www.textbookleague.org/73shark.htm\">repeated by sources</a> both authoritative (textbooks) and slightly less so (Ripley's Believe It or Not!): Sharks must move constantly in order to breathe, or they die.</p> \n<p>But for most species, that's not true. Sharks employ two methods to breathe. Ram ventilation entails swimming constantly, which forces water over the gills. Buccal pumping uses muscles in the mouth to pull liquid over the gills. Fish in this latter group, including angel and nurse sharks, don't need perpetual motion and can rest on the seafloor. Many shark species can use both techniques . About 20 species can't, though even they won't necessarily die if they stop swimming. Researchers have discovered that some of these animals can remain relatively stationary: In 1972, Caribbean reef sharks were <a href=\"http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/b_40_winks.htm\">observed</a> at rest in a Mexican cave. </p> \n<em>3. Sharks don't get cancer.</em> <p>William Lane's 1992 bestseller,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064XQ5MY?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B0064XQ5MY&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=thewaspos09-20\"> \"Sharks Don't Get Cancer: How Shark Cartilage Could Save Your Life,\"</a> helped popularize the mythical notion of sharks' invincibility. The book seemed at least partially grounded in reality: Research from the previous decade suggested that inserting shark cartilage into certain animals inhibited the growth of blood vessels that nourish <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/221/4616/1185\">tumors,</a> and that sharks had <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0820_030820_sharkcancer.html\">lower incidences</a> of cancer than humans did. Lane's book acknowledged that sharks occasionally get cancer, just not often. But it was the misleading title that resonated. </p>\n<p>It's been known since 1908 that sharks get cancer; that was when the first incidence of a malignant growth was <a href=\"http://www.sharksavers.org/en/education/biology/myth-sharks-don-t-get-cancer\">discovered</a> in a specimen. More recently, a comprehensive 2004 <a href=\"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/64/23/8485.full\">study</a> found 42 carcinomas in Chondrichthyes species, the class of cartilaginous fish that encompasses sharks, skates and rays. To date, cancer has been documented in 23 species of sharks. </p> \n<p>No scientific evidence shows that cartilage from these animals can prevent us from getting cancer or cure it, as Lane argued. In 2005, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine gave a brand of cartilage called BeneFin to patients who had advanced bowel or breast cancer. There were <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/shark-cartilage\">no positive effects</a>. </p> \n<p>Yet Lane made handsome profits through his company, LaneLabs, selling shark cartilage extracts to ease rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and diabetic retinopathy, an eye condition. The global market for such products was thought to have exceeded <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/mythbusting-101-sharks-will-cure-cancer/\">$30 million</a> by 1995. In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/News/shark.html\">sued</a> LaneLabs to prevent the company from marketing shark cartilage as an effective cancer treatment. Lane later <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/12/nyregion/metro-business-2-cartilage-concerns-settle-federal-suit.html\">agreed</a> to pay a $1 million settlement. </p> \n<em>4. Aerial patrols keep people safe from sharks.</em> <p>A string of shark sightings and attacks in the past few years has prompted a number of Australian states to <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/shark-nets-for-busselton-and-more-aerial-patrols-in-wa-20140926-10mjg7.html\">increase aerial patrols</a> , manned aircraft that monitor recreational waters for sharks. But after decades of operation along the coast there, there's <a href=\"http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/429691/Robbins-Peddemors-and-Kennelly_Aerial-Surveys_Report.pdf\">little evidence</a> to suggest that this has any practical benefit in keeping swimmers safe. </p> \n<p>Airplanes or helicopters have to survey a vast area in just a few hours. Some species, including the great white, are ambush hunters and come up to the surface only when they strike. Others lie deeper in the ocean; if the water is murky or the skies not clear, they can be almost undetectable. </p> \n<p>A smarter way to ensure beachgoers' safety is a \" <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-22/fact-file-protecting-people-from-shark-attacks/5164882\">shark barrier</a>,\" currently used in parts of Australia and Hong Kong . These thin mesh nets - which aren't harmful to wildlife and shouldn't be confused with shark nets - form an underwater fence from seabed to surface around beaches and keep predators out.</p> \n<em>5. A shark attack is a case of \"mistaken identity.\"</em> <p>After an attack, media outlets often quote experts who say the shark <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/06/15/north-carolina-shark-attack-leaves-teen-girl-severely-hurt/\">mistook</a> the human for something else; authorities including <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sharks/FS_faq.htm\">the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> reiterate that attacks on people are \"usually a case of mistaken identity.\" </p> \n<p>But plenty of <a href=\"http://www.naturalexplorer.co.uk/latest-news-and-reports/dispelling-the-myths-about-sharks\">evidence</a> suggests that shark attacks on humans, though rare, are intentional. Sometimes simple curiosity prompts a bite. A shark might also attack humans if they're in its territory or if it sees them as competition for food. </p> \n<p> Some species have highly refined senses, and these remarkable hunters know exactly what kind of animal they are pursuing. These species will prey upon people. The tiger shark, nicknamed the \"dustbin of the seas,\" will eat practically anything - remains of horses, dogs, license plates, tires and people have been found in their stomachs. Bull sharks have been <a href=\"http://www.sharks-world.com/bull_shark/\">implicated</a> in many human fatalities. And the oceanic whitetip, which oceanographer Jacques Cousteau described as \"the most dangerous of all sharks,\" has been known to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2338825/Brave-diver-keeps-cool-circled-8ft-man-eating-sharks-crystal-clear-Caribbean-waters.html\">target</a> shipwreck and plane-crash survivors. </p> \n<strong> <i>xavjudd@googlemail.com</i> </strong> <p>Five myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

That's not the only way that sharks are consumed, however. A new 200-page <a href=\"http://sharkyear.com/2015/fao-report-state-of-the-global-market-for-shark-products.html\">report</a> from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization finds that the market for shark meat has increased an astonishing 42 percent between 2000 and 2010.</p>\n<p>The study quantifies what many researchers had already begun to suspect. \"We had a sense that the shark meat trade was increasing,\" said one of the report's authors, Shelley Clarke of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. Even so, the data surprised them, revealing new markets for shark meat that have emerged due to globalization. \"The magnitude of the increase and the extent to which it is concentrated in Brazil for shark meat, and Korea for skate and ray meat, were striking,\" she said.</p>\n<p>The total value for all of the worldwide trade in shark meat and fins was estimated at nearly $1 billion, according to the report.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the world's shark species currently face dramatic population declines due to decades of overfishing. Some species have lost 99 percent of their populations.</p>\n<p>\"These species are in global crisis,\" said Luke Warwick, acting director of the global shark conservation campaign for The Pew Charitable Trusts, who was not affiliated with the study. \"Because sharks grow slowly, mature late and bear few young, they can't recover from depleted populations quickly enough, especially if they continue to be killed at a rate of about 100 million, year after year.\"</p>\n<p>He said current mortality rates are probably double what could be considered sustainable.  \"The widespread global meat and fin markets showcased in this report demonstrate the scale of the problem these top oceanic predators face.\"</p>\n<p>One unexpected cause for some of this increase is actually the same laws that were designed to help sharks by reducing the shark-fin trade. Regulations now encourage using the entire shark instead of catching the fish, chopping off its fins and dumping the carcass back into the ocean. The report credits anti-finning regulations along with increasing demand for shark meat-which is also considered a delicacy in many countries-for what it calls a \"considerable\" expansion in the market for shark meat.</p>\n<strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/05/12/fishermen-are-catching-fewer-sharks-because-there-are-fewer-sharks\">Fewer Sharks Are Being Caught-and That's Not Good News</a></strong> <p>That said, Clarke said the fact that fishermen need to bring in the entire shark-instead of just the fins-is actually helpful. \"There is certainly a benefit in landing whole those sharks that are killed because this contributes to better estimates of catches and better species identification,\" she said. It's often difficult if not impossible to identify a shark species solely on its fin. \"This in turn helps scientists better understand the status of various populations and what further steps are necessary to conserve them.\" The report found that the markets for shark fins and shark meat are largely distinct from each other.</p>\n<p>The study doesn't identify many specific shark species threatened by the meat trade because most nations don't compile such statistics. They just lump them into broad categories such as \"shark.\" FAO is advocating for a change in these trade codes, and indeed some countries such as Thailand already have enacted changes to make the report's data more accurate.</p>\n<p>Clarke said she expects the report to provide a valuable new tool for understanding the shark trade and helping nations to manage sharks and shark products. Other efforts will also help. Clarke and Warwick both pointed to new rules enacted last by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species that protected five shark species and all related manta rays, as well as to the 10 new shark sanctuaries that have recently been established. \"These actions will hopefully prove successful in decreasing the number of sharks internationally traded towards a level that can be sustainable,\" Warwick said.</p>\n<h2><strong>Related stories on TakePart:</strong></h2>\n<strong>* <a href=\"http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/07/06/philippines-gets-little-safer-endangered-sharks-and-rays\"> The Philippines Gets a Little Safer for Endangered Sharks and Rays</a></strong> <strong>* <a href=\"http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/06/22/shark-fin-ban-texas\">The Giant Problem of Shark Finning Just Became a Little Smaller</a></strong> <p><a href=\"http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/07/31/humans-are-eating-42-percent-more-sharks-threatening-species?cmpid=tp-rss\"><i>Original article</i></a> from TakePart</p>\n</div>",

A new 200-page report from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization finds that the market for shark meat has increased an astonishing 42 percent between 2000 and 2010.</p><p>The study quantifies what many researchers had already begun to suspect. \"We had a sense that the shark meat trade was increasing,\" said one of the report's authors, Shelley Clarke of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. Even so, the data surprised them, revealing new markets for shark meat that have emerged due to globalization. \"The magnitude of the increase and the extent to which it is concentrated in Brazil for shark meat, and Korea for skate and ray meat, were striking,\" she said.</p><p>The total value for all of the worldwide trade in shark meat and fins was estimated at nearly $1 billion, according to the report.</p><p>Almost all of the world's shark species currently face dramatic population declines due to decades of overfishing. Some species have lost 99 percent of their populations.</p><p>\"These species are in global crisis,\" said Luke Warwick, acting director of the global shark conservation campaign for The Pew Charitable Trusts, who was not affiliated with the study. \"Because sharks grow slowly, mature late and bear few young, they can't recover from depleted populations quickly enough, especially if they continue to be killed at a rate of about 100 million, year after year.\"</p><p>He said current mortality rates are probably double what could be considered sustainable. \"The widespread global meat and fin markets showcased in this report demonstrate the scale of the problem these top oceanic predators face.\"</p><p>One unexpected cause for some of this increase is actually the same laws that were designed to help sharks by reducing the shark-fin trade. Regulations now encourage using the entire shark instead of catching the fish, chopping off its fins and dumping the carcass back into the ocean. The report credits anti-finning regulations along with increasing demand for shark meat-which is also considered a delicacy in many countries-for what it calls a \"considerable\" expansion in the market for shark meat.</p> RELATED: Fewer Sharks Are Being Caught-and That's Not Good News<p>That said, Clarke said the fact that fishermen need to bring in the entire shark-instead of just the fins-is actually helpful. \"There is certainly a benefit in landing whole those sharks that are killed because this contributes to better estimates of catches and better species identification,\" she said. It's often difficult if not impossible to identify a shark species solely on its fin. \"This in turn helps scientists better understand the status of various populations and what further steps are necessary to conserve them.\" The report found that the markets for shark fins and shark meat are largely distinct from each other.</p><p>The study doesn't identify many specific shark species threatened by the meat trade because most nations don't compile such statistics. They just lump them into broad categories such as \"shark.\" FAO is advocating for a change in these trade codes, and indeed some countries such as Thailand already have enacted changes to make the report's data more accurate.</p><p>Clarke said she expects the report to provide a valuable new tool for understanding the shark trade and helping nations to manage sharks and shark products. Other efforts will also help. Clarke and Warwick both pointed to new rules enacted last by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species that protected five shark species and all related manta rays, as well as to the 10 new shark sanctuaries that have recently been established. \"These actions will hopefully prove successful in decreasing the number of sharks internationally traded towards a level that can be sustainable,\" Warwick said.</p>Related stories on TakePart: * The Philippines Gets a Little Safer for Endangered Sharks and Rays * The Giant Problem of Shark Finning Just Became a Little Smaller<p>Original article from TakePart</p>",

      content: "From Wikipedia: Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. However, the term \"shark\" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus, as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago. Acanthodians are often referred to as \"spiny sharks\"; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper, they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole.\n\nSince then, sharks have diversified into over 500 species. They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (39 ft) in length. Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can survive and be found in both seawater and freshwater. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have several sets of replaceable teeth.",
