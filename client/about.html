                  <p>
                    Online viewers increasingly want unique video experiences that are engaging and interactive, not passive. With DeepStream, you can quickly and easily build those experiences from almost any video source. By comparing video viewership behavior on regular YouTube videos to those that have been enhanced with DeepStream, we have seen increases in time spent watching up to 100%. Additionally, because DeepStream lets you include related media, you benefit from this new avenue for viewer engagement and can see up to 20% click rates on your content.

                  <p><b>Give viewers the opportunity to explore more of your content during the video experience instead of watching and leaving.</b></p>
                  <p>
                   Today, too many video views are one-and-done, with the viewer leaving your page after watching. By giving your viewers the opportunity to explore more of your content in a fun and interactive way you can build a stronger relationship with your audience, turning viewers into fans and supporters. DeepStream enables you to tell richer, deeper stories without the friction of current content systems. The result is a quick-to-market video experience that is perfect for breaking news events and deeper stories that viewers can explore, reinforcing the quality of your brand.
