                  <p><b>Give viewers the opportunity to explore more of your content during the video experience instead of watching and leaving.</b></p>
                  <p>
                   Today, too many video views are one-and-done, with the viewer leaving your page after watching. By giving your viewers the opportunity to explore more of your content in a fun and interactive way you can build a stronger relationship with your audience, turning viewers into fans and supporters. DeepStream enables you to tell richer, deeper stories without the friction of current content systems. The result is a quick-to-market video experience that is perfect for breaking news events and deeper stories that viewers can explore, reinforcing the quality of your brand.
